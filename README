A set of tools to work with the special LED on R-Go Tools Split
keyboards on GNU/Linux.


Installation
------------

r-go-led, the program to set the state of the LED, uses the hidraw
interface of Linux. This means you need to have the Linux API headers
for your kernel installed during compilation.

x11idle needs libX11 and libXss to query the state of the X11
screensaver extension.

To compile these two programs, run:

    $ make


Running
-------

Run r-go-led without arguments for a short summary of options. During
runtime, this program needs access to /dev/hidraw* -- use sudo or udev
rules for that.

x11idle just prints the current X11 idle time.

r-go-break-reminder combines both tools. It detects long streaks of user
activity and then activates the LED, until the user took a break for a
while. It expects that the other two tools are available in your $PATH.
