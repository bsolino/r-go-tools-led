A set of tools to work with the special LED on R-Go Tools Split
keyboards on GNU/Linux.


Installation
------------

r-go-led, the program to set the state of the LED, uses the hidraw
interface of Linux. This means you need to have the Linux API headers
for your kernel installed during compilation.

To compile it, run:

    $ make

The script r-go-break-reminder needs xprintidle (there is a package for
it on Arch Linux and Ubuntu):

    - https://github.com/g0hl1n/xprintidle


Running
-------

r-go-led needs access to /dev/hidraw* during runtime. Use sudo or udev
rules for that. Refer to the manpage for an example using udev, and of
course for a full list of command line options.

r-go-break-reminder detects long streaks of user activity and then
activates the LED, until the user took a break for a while. It expects
that r-go-led is available in your $PATH.
